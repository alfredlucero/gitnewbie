LEARN GIT:

git status (check if any changes)
git log (check all commit list)
		--author="name" (shows commits only from this author)

Start a repository/project:
	- git init
	- git add . (add all changes made to our project)
			  filename.txt (add to stage area/purgatory) // working copy > staging area > repository
	- git commit -m "first commit" (takes snapshot in point in time so we can go back to it)
