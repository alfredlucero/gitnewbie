LEARN GIT:

git status (check if any changes)
git log (check all commit list)
		--author="name" (shows commits only from this author)

Start a repository/project:
	- git init  (creates repository)
	- git add . (add all changes made to our project)
			  filename.txt (add to stage area/purgatory) // working copy > staging area > repository
	- git reset HEAD filename.txt (removes from staging area)
	- git commit -m "first commit" (takes snapshot in point in time so we can go back to it)
				 -am "message" (adds and commits all edited files in working copy to repository already)
	- git rm filename.txt (removed from repository and working copy, then commit changes after)
	- git mv oldname.txt newname.txt (rename), oldname.txt filedest
	- git checkout -- filename.txt (take from repository and make it the working copy)
				   commit# -- filename.txt (or nothing for all the changes) -> git checkout -b branchname (retain old changes in branch)
				   
Viewing the changes that we made:
	-git diff (hit q to exit, shows difference between working copy and repository)
			  --staged (compare staged/added but no commit to repository)

Branches: 
	git branch (check which branch you're on)
	git checkout -b branchname (create a branch)
				 -d branchname (delete a local branch)
				 branch (move to another branch)
				 
GITHUB:
1. Creating a new repository on the command line
	echo # gitnewbie >> README.md
	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/alfredlucero/gitnewbie.git
	git push -u origin master
2. Pushing an existing repository from the command line (pushing to servers)
	// git remote (gives name of remote repo)
	git remote add origin https://github.com/alfredlucero/gitnewbie.git
	git push -u origin master
	-> pushing changes to remote repository
	git commit -m "message"
	git tag v1.0 (creates tag)
	git push origin master (pushes files onto repo)
	git push origin v1.0 (pushes tag)

fetching (retrieve from server)
